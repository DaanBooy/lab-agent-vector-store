    "\n",
    "The recommended method for doing so is to create a `RetrievalQA` and then use that as a tool in the overall agent. Let's take a look at doing this below. You can do this with multiple different vector DBs, and use the agent as a way to route between them. There are two different ways of doing this - you can either let the agent use the vector stores as normal tools, or you can set `return_direct=True` to really just use the agent as a router."

It also aims to replace other code quality tools such as Black, isort, yesqa, eradicate, and most of the rules implemented in pyupgrade. Ruff is designed to be used alongside a type checker, and it supports any Python version from 3.7 onwards. It is installable under any Python version from 3.7 onwards and does not require the installation of Rust. Ruff's linter and formatter can be used independently of each other, and it supports editor integration and various settings for customization.\u001b[0m\n",
